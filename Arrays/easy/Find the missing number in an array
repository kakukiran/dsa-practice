Problem Statement: Given an integer N and an array of size N-1 containing N-1 numbers between 1 to N. 
Find the number(between 1 to N), that is not present in the given array

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,4,5}
Result: 3
Explanation: In the given array, number 3 is missing. So, 3 is the answer.


Example 2:
Input Format: N = 3, array[] = {1,3}
Result: 2
Explanation: In the given array, number 2 is missing. So, 2 is the answer.

{
    public static int missingUsingSum(int[] arr, int N) 
    {
        int expectedSum = N * (N + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) 
        {
            actualSum += arr[i];
        }
        return expectedSum - actualSum;
    }
}
